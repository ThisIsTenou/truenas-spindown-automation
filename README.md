# truenas-spindown-automation
A script to bring up a pool, run a replication task and bring it down again. Developed for my specific environment and should be nothing but an inspiration to you. Do not expect being able to "just run it".

Yes, the script is a slight mess. No, it is absolutely not properly documented. Still, if you invest the time into reading a bit into it, you might find something interesting.
If you wanna know something specific, feel free to file an issue - I'll happily explain you the details.
